What are the three major components of the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm?,"The three major components of the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm are:

1. Retrieval Sources: These are the sources of information that are used for retrieval in the generation process. They can include training corpora, external data, unsupervised data, and task-specific retrieval sources.

2. Retrieval Metrics: These metrics are used to measure the relevance or similarity between the retrieved information and the generation task. They can include sparse-vector retrieval metrics, dense-vector retrieval metrics, and task-specific retrieval metrics.

3. Generation Models: These models are responsible for generating the final output based on the retrieved information. They can be machine learning models or other types of models depending on the specific task.

These components work together to enhance the generation process by incorporating relevant information from retrieval sources.","['∗All authors contributed equally.\nﬁrstly present the generic paradigm of retrieval-\naugmented generation as well as three key com-\nponents under this paradigm, which are retrieval\nsources, retrieval metrics and generation models.\nThen, we introduce notable methods about\nretrieval-augmented generation, which are orga-\nnized with respect to different tasks.
