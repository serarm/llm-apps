Introduction
Retrieval-augmented text generation, as a new
text generation paradigm that fuses emerging deep
learning technology and traditional retrieval tech-
nology, has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) per-
formance in many NLP tasks and attracted the at-
tention of the computational linguistics community",Retrieval-augmented text generation,

2021). Compared with generation-based counter-
part, this new paradigm has some remarkable ad-
